    <string name="p1">In the light of the moon a little egg lay on a leaf. </string>
    <string name="p2"> One Sunday morning, the warm sun came up and POP! - Out of the egg came a tiny and very hungry caterpillar. </string>
    <string name="p3">He started to look for some food. On Monday he ate through one apple, But he was still hungry. </string>
    <string name="p4">On Tuesday, he ate through two pears, But he was still hungry. </string>
    <string name="p5">On Wednesday, he ate through three plums, But he was still hungry. </string>
    <string name="p6">On Thursday, he ate through four strawberries, But he was still hungry. </string>
    <string name="p7">On Friday, he ate through five oranges, But he was still hungry. </string>
    <string name="p8">On Saturday he ate through one piece of chocolate cake, one ice-cream cone, one pickle, one slice of swiss cheese,
    one slice of salami, one lollipop, one piece of cherry pie, one sausage,
    one cupcake, and one slice of watermelon. That night he had a stomachache! </string>
    <string name="p9">The next day was Sunday again. The caterpillar ate through one nice green leaf, and after that he felt much better.</string>
    <string name="p10">But now he wasn\'t hungry anymore. And he wasn\'t a little caterpillar anymore. He was a big fat caterpillar. </string>
    <string name="p11">He built a small house around himself, called a Cocoon, And he stayed inside for more than two weeks. </string>
    <string name="p12">Then he nibbled a hole in the cocoon, pushed his way out, and  </string>
    <string name="p13">He was a beautiful butterfly. </string>
    <string name="end">The End </string>
